## What it does
The deep learning algorithm mainly Sketch RNN tries to make the drawings of various objects or animals like "Cat", "Map", "Airplane", "Butterfly", etc. We need to select the tags and the artificial intelligence brain tries to make it and gives us a drawing related to what we had chosen. Children could use this tool to first learn the drawing by seeing it and then use the provided sketch pad to draw out on their own. Just like kids love to draw, they also love music, so they could also learn to play their very own mini piano! Not only kids, but adults can also use these tools in their leisure time to relive their old school hobbies.

## How we built it
* We built the project mainly using `p5.js` , `ML5.js` , `Javascript` , `Tensorflow.js` and for front end we have used `HTML`, `CSS`, and `BOOTSTRAP`.
* This project is mainly based on Sketch RNN(recurrent neural networks) , which analyses human sketches and presents them on a vector format. RNN's can learn and remember context in prediction problems for machine learning. This is also the reason it has now been explored in modelling images.
* The `Sketch-RNN` would seek and learn information from loads of drawings by humans which are again segregated into different classes and is trained to generate them.
* The dataset for the neural network model was obtained from Google's QuickDraw(https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) , an AI web application where the researchers asked users to draw objects a specific class.
